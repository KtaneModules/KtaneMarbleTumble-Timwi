  title: Marble Tumble
  description: "Once upon a time, there was a marble named Bob. But Bob was unhappy,
    because Bob wasn\u2019t in the center. He wanted nothing more out of life than
    to be in the center. Unfortunately, in order to get to the center, he needed the
    fabled wizard, the Defuser, to align the passages in just the right way. The Defuser
    was sympathetic to Bob\u2019s plight and promised to try to help in every way
    that he can; however, the Defuser was a bumbling old fool and occasionally cast
    the wrong spell, causing Bob to fall into a devious, mischievous trap from which
    the only escape was to go back in time and try again! Will the wizard cast the
    right spells? Will Bob reach his goal? Gather around the campfire and listen to
    my story as I reveal the harrowing details of Bob\u2019s adventure!\n\nModule
